# Analyzing students' mental health in SQL

In this SQL project, we'll use your PostgreSQL skills to analyze the student data from a Japanese international university and spot one of the most influencing factors impacting the mental health of international students.

The survey conducted by the university demonstrated that the main challenges for international students are social connectedness and the stress associated with joining a new culture. We will focus on a specific contributing factorâ€”the length of stay and how it impacts the average diagnostic scores of international students.
